JAVASCRIPT PROJECTS

These 3 are the main projects I worked on

Calculator
Making a working calculator, and changing code around to work with my own designs, This can be used for math equations

Pizza Menu
This is just like ordering a pizza from an online store, I didnt have time to customize it so the background is just black.
Would of been fun to work something up for this one

Tic Tac Toe
Making a Tic Tac Toe game vs a set of rules I instructed the computer to play, I also customized the sounds within this game to sounds of cats cuz I thought it was funny

I also worked on smaller projects and a bunch of HTML websites that were for practicing writing certain code
